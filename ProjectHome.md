Metablog, as it is initially called, is a Django-based multi-media extendable blog application. MetaBlog will eventually enable users to create Blog-entries in the form of articles, photographs, video (vodcast), audio (podcast) or any other format desired.

Main feature is that all entries can be linked to one another, creating rich semantic relations between content. Off course it will also be offering tagging, categories, comments, weblinks, sitemaps, Google pings and syndication.

Note that the project has just started, a stable version is not to be expected within less than a year.
